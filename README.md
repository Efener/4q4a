4 questions 4 answers.


The numbers.txt file is needed for question 4.
I made some comments for myself, if I forgot or need to come check the code for later.
These comments may help you to understand the functions.
These are my begginer works so they may not be efficient.

Questions:
1. Create an inline function to calculate the area of a sphere.
In your main function take the radius from the user and store these values inside a double
array. Keep storing values so long as the user input isnâ€™t a negative value. Then call your
inline function to calculate the area for each of the sphere and print them onto the screen.


2. Define two function prototypes squareByValue and squareByReference, former have a
return type of integer and latter have return type void. Both functions should have only 1
positive integer parameter. squareByValue should have a pass by value implementation
while squareByReference should have pass by reference implementation.
Inside your main function get two positive integer values from the user. Send the first
value to squareByValue function and the latter value to squareByReference and print out
the contents of these variables after functions are called.
While implementing function body of each of these functions, take the square of the
parameter value.

3. Create a prototype function called swap that takes one integer parameter and changes its
value with a random number between 1 and 100.
In the main function create two integer variables x (define a value of your choice) and y
and make y an alias for x. Then print out the original values of x and y. Then pass the y
into your swap function. Then, send your y value into swap function as a parameter. At the
end of your program, print out values of both x and y again.



4. Create a txt file with 10 positive integers of your choice written inside and place it in the
root folder of your project.
Within your cpp file, create a prototype function called swap_with_file that takes integer
changes its value with a randomly selected value from your file. (You need to read the file
contents)
In the main function, create two integer variables x (define a value of your choice) and y
and make y an empty reference. Then print out the original values of x and y. Then pass
the y into your swap function. Then, send your y value into swap function as a parameter.
At the end of your program, print out values of both x and y again.
